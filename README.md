# Covid-19-Analysis-using-Azure-Data-Factory

Hey everyone

I have just completed a project on Azure Data Factory 
where I had built a Fully Automated solution for covid 19 data. 
by ingesting the data from HTTP sources available on the ECDC website, 
and creating ETL pipelines using Data Flows, Azure DataBricks, and HDinsight.
created Dashboards in Power BI after loading the transformed Data to Azure
